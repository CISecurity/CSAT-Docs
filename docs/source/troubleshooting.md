##Implementation Group drop-down issue##

If all the assessments in your CSAT Pro instance use the same IG and you don't use any custom applicability flags for individual Sub-Controls, then this bug shouldn't affect you.

If you have assessments with different IG or custom applicability flags, please verify that the applicability flag for each Sub-Control/task is set to the intended state.
